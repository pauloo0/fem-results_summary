## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This being my first real project working with more complex css, I learned a lot on how I could customize my own values on tailwindCSS and also learned the basics of using gradients on tailwindCSS.
I also learned more about creating a responsive design.

### Continued development

Overall I still need to learn a lot about responsive design. Maybe consider a Mobile-first workflow. From this experience I found it tricky to get the mobile design accurate.
I want to continue learning about placement and positioning because I found that my widths, heights, margins, paddings and such didn't came out the same as the design.
